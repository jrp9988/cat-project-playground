# cat-project-playground

Crafting exercise:

Create an app that loads images from the network and formats them into a feed layout (similar to an Instagram or Google Images feed). Use the Cat API with the provided API key to retrieve a set of 15-20 image URLs. For this exercise, please only use Android base framework/libraries, not any third party libraries for networking or image downloading. This app should be optimized for performance in terms of network and memory usage. 

Use the Cat API (https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5578104/RWgqUxxh#997f5b37-79cc-49a4-8c11-ddf24b72a4d9) to supply the images to load within the app. 

Constraints
No use of advanced libraries (Picasso, etc.)
You can use Google to lookup Android APIs
Collaboration with team in the room is okay, we can help brainstorm and work through design considerations
